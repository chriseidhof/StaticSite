# StaticSite

This contains a bunch of helper functions to generate a static site in Swift.

We use this library to generate <https:///www.objc.io> and <https://chris.eidhof.nl>. We would not recommend depending on this, as the library is going to change whenever we need it. Ultimately, we would not mind creating an actual library that you can depend on, but we didn't have the time for that just yet.

Here's a sample site that uses this: [chriseidhof/chriseidhofnl](https://github.com/chriseidhof/chriseidhofnl).

Here are some things we'd like to do:

- [ ] A short explanation of the `Rule` type with some examples
- [ ] Full documentation
